        Half a year later and still Hilton hotel did not refund the money thats was overcharged. Most likely people like Volcan Amac steal money from customers this way.
    Lovely hotel but reception was rude, lazy and impolite. Check your credit card payment, I was overcharged eur 80 on a eur 400 per night room and despite promises and  credit invoice it was never returned.
